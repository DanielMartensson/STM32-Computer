description: |
  STMicroelectronics's STM32 MPUs are able to monitor High Speed External
  oscillator frequency. Based on a lptimer, it is possible to detect a
  overclock frequency which can corrupt the system. The frequency overclock
  detection is detected thanks to High Speed Internal oscillator reference
  (hsi).

properties:
  compatible:
    const: st,freq-monitor

  counter:
    description: Counter used to monitor the frequency.
      Refer to counter.yaml for more details.

  clocks:
    minItems: 2
    maxItems: 2

  clock-names:
    items:
      - const: hse
      - const: hsi

required:
  - compatible

additionalProperties: false

examples:
- |
  hse_monitor: hse-monitor {
    compatible = "st,freq-monitor";
    counter = <&lptimer3 1 1 0 0>;
    clocks = <&rcc CK_HSE>, <&rcc CK_HSI>;
    clock-names = "hse", "hsi";
