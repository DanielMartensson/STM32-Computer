title: STMicroelectronics STM32 Factory-programmed data bindings

description: |
  This represents STM32 Factory-programmed read only non-volatile area: locked
  flash, OTP, read-only HW regs... This contains various information such as:
  analog calibration data for temperature sensor (e.g. TS_CAL1, TS_CAL2),
  internal vref (VREFIN_CAL), unique device ID...

        description: |
          This property explicits a factory programmed area that both secure
          and non-secure worlds can access. It is needed when, by default, the
          related area can only be reached by the secure world.
          It requires to be 32 bits word aligned to allow non-secure sharing.
          Not supported by stm32mp25.

      st,non-secure-otp-provisioning:
        description: |
          This property explicits a factory programmed area that allows a non-secure
          read and write until the first programmed value. Once the provisioning of
          the specified area is done, access from non-secure is forbidden.
          It is needed when, by default, the related area is empty and must be provisioned.

          This property explicits a factory programmed area that secure
