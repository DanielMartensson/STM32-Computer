STM32 Independent WatchDoG (IWDG)
---------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "st,stm32mp1-iwdg".
- reg: physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.
- clocks: reference to the clock entry lsi. Additional pclk clock entry.
  is required only for st,stm32mp1-iwdg.
- clock-names: name of the clocks used.
  "pclk", "lsi" for st,stm32mp1-iwdg.

Optional properties:
- timeout-sec: Watchdog timeout value in seconds.
- secure-timeout-sec: Watchdog early timeout management in seconds.
- stm32,enable-on-stop: Keep watchdog enable during stop.
- stm32,enable-on-standby: Keep watchdog enable durung standby.

Examples:

iwdg2: iwdg@5a002000 {
	compatible = "st,stm32mp1-iwdg";
	reg = <0x5a002000 0x400>;
	clocks = <&rcc IWDG2>, <&clk_lsi>;
	clock-names = "pclk", "lsi";
	instance = <2>;
	timeout-sec = <30>;
};
