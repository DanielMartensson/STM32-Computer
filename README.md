# Notes

To produce this board, the manufacture need to have these minimum capabilities:

# How to get Linux working on this custom board

Here is a manual to get `OpenSTLinux` or `STM32-OS` to work on `STM32-Computer`.

```

There are two types of flash layouts that you can use:

1. `FlashLayout - Bootfs.tsv` for only re-flashing the `kernel` and `.dtb` file. Great use for debugging purposes.
2. `FlashLayout - STM32-OS.tsv` for flashing the whole system with `rootfs.ext4`

Flip the `BOOT1` (blue switch) to `OFF` when you're about to flash the eMMC. Flip the `BOOT1` to `ON` when you want to boot from the eMMC.

# TODO

* Nothing more. Everything is working

# Errata

In order to make sure that the `OpenSTLinux` or `STM32-OS` will work on `STM32MP15XXAC` processor, one must do the following

## Change the `kernel/trace/trace.c`

One huge problem inside `linux kernel` is that the workqueue `eval_map_wq` contains important initial calls for devices such as `STPMIC`.
When that workqueue is destoryed, the linux kernel halts, without any errors. I belive that it destroys the communication to the `STPMIC`. Not sure, becuase it's very difficullt to debug this thing using `UART`.

But to solve that issue, then comment `destroy_workqueue(eval_map_wq);`. It's not a standard way to do this. The problem lies on STMicroelectronics to make sure that the workqueue do not destroy important devices, which now, it currently doing.

```c
static int __init trace_eval_sync(void)
{
	/* Make sure the eval map updates are finished */
	if (eval_map_wq){
		/*destroy_workqueue(eval_map_wq); */
	}
	return 0;
}
```

## Change the `drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq-dt-platdev.c`

This is a common issue. It's not a bug or so, it's just that the developers of `STMicroelectronics` has forgotten to adapt their `OpenSTLinux` code for the `STM32MP151` series, and only for `STM32MP157` and `STM32MP153`. But make the code suitable for the `STM32MP151` series by adding support for it. Add this line `{ .compatible = "st,stm32mp151", },` so your device trees will work with the linux kernel.

```c
/*
 * Machines for which the cpufreq device is *not* created, mostly used for
 * platforms using "operating-points-v2" property.
 */
static const struct of_device_id blocklist[] __initconst = {
	{ .compatible = "allwinner,sun50i-h6", },
	...
	..
	.
    { .compatible = "st,stih407", },
	{ .compatible = "st,stih410", },
	{ .compatible = "st,stih418", },
	{ .compatible = "st,stm32mp157", },
	{ .compatible = "st,stm32mp151", },
	...
	..
	.
	{ .compatible = "qcom,msm8974", },
	{ .compatible = "qcom,msm8960", },

	{ }
};
```
