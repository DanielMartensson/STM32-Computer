  st,tamp-passive-precharge:
    description: 0 is no precharge, so the pull-up is disabled for all external passive tamper.
       1, 2, 3, 4, 8 define the number of cycle the STM32 precharge the pin before
       checking the value (low/high) for all external tamper.

    description: Set the active tamper filtering. 0 when active tamper filtering is disabled.
      1 when active tamper filtering is enabled. A tamper event is detected when 2 comparison

  st,trig-on:
    description: Defines the active level to activate this passive tamper
      (not used if pintctrl-0 as 2 entries).
      It also depends on st,tamp-passive-precharge value. When st,tamp-passive-precharge=0
      this passive tamper activate at edge. When st,tamp-passive-precharge != 0, with st,trig-on
      defined, this passive tamper will activate if st,tamp-passive-nb-sample in a row are high.
      If not defined the passive tamper event is raised if st,tamp-passive-nb-sample in a row
      are low.

  st,backup-zones:

                 access restrictions varies from one platform to another.
                 For STM32MP1x platforms, it corresponds to
                 <zone1 zone1 zone3>
                 For STM32MP2x platforms, it corresponds to

      Describes the firewall hardware configuration to apply for a given
      resource.

      RIFPROT(tamp_res_id, sem_list, lock, sec, priv, scid, sem_en, cfen)

      When a field isn't effective, it should be filled with RIF_UNUSED.

        "tamp_res_id" The tamp resource number.

        "sem_list" This peripheral does not support semaphores.
                   This field must be set to RIF_UNUSED.

        "lock" This peripheral does not support configuration locking.
               This field must be set to RIF_UNUSED.

        "sec" Configures secure-only access to the resource.
          RIF_SEC, only secure access is granted to the resource
          RIF_NSEC, secure/non-secure access is granted to the
                    resource

        "priv" Configures the privilege level needed to access this
               resource.
          RIF_PRIV, only privileged access is granted to the resource
          RIF_NPRIV, privileged/Unprivileged access is granted to the
                     resource

        "scid" Configures the static CID that is allowed to access the
               resource. Note that the static CID configuration is
               ineffective if the semaphore mode is enabled. Mandates CID
               filtering enabled to be effective.
          RIF_CID1 allows CID 1 to access the resource
          RIF_CID2 allows CID 2 to access the resource ...

        "sem_en" This peripheral does not support semaphores.
                 This field must be set to RIF_UNUSED.

        "cfen" Enable/disable the CID filtering for this resource.
          RIF_CFEN, enables the CID filtering
          RIF_CFDIS, disables the CID filtering

  st,tamp-internal-tampers:
    $ref: "/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array"
    description:
      List of the internal tamper detection cells to be enabled and whether they
      should be enabled in potential or confirmed mode. Each entry is composed
      of 2 arguments. The first one is the ID of the tamper to activate. The
      second one is the mode.

  st,tamp-mode:
    description:
      Only for external tampers.
      Either TAMPER_CONFIRMED_MODE or TAMPER_POTENTIAL_MODE to configure the
      external tamper either in confirmed or potential mode.

  st,tamp-id:

    description: ID of a tamper event
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 32

  st,tamp-mask-pot-reset:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Mask the reset control line of some resources when a potential tamper
      occurs. Please refer to the SoC reference manual to see what resource
      it concerns.
