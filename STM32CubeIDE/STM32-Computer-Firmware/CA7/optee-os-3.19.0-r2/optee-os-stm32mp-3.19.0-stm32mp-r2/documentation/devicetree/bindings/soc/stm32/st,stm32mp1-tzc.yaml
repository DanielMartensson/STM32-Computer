title: STM32MP1 TrustZone address space bindings

description: |
  The STM32MP1 TZC is an ARM TZC400 based DDR access controller. It uses filters
  to control read/write access to the DDR.
  TZC node specifies a list of phandles to specific reserved memory regions.
  It uses the defined bindings in rmem.yaml and adding a specific property
  for the access right management.

  memory-region:
    description: |
      Phandle to a node describing memory area to be configured by the TZC.
      The reserved region must describe a st,protreg property that will contain the specific
      access management for a region.
      - The "st,protreg" property defines the memory access type with a secure access and non
        secure access field. Secure access initial u32 uses:
          TZC_REGION_S_NONE: No secure access available
          TZC_REGION_S_RD: Secure access Read only
          TZC_REGION_S_WR: Secure access Write only
          TZC_REGION_S_RDWR: Secure access Read/Write
        The non secure access uses a u32 refering to the Non secure master. The list of the NSAID
        are described in the dt-bindings/soc/stm32mp13-tzc400.h for STM32MP13 and in
        dt-bindings/soc/stm32mp15-tzc400.h for STM32MP15. The TZC400 macro can be used to
        create the u32. Ex:
         (TZC_REGION_ACCESS_RD(1) | TZC_REGION_ACCESS_WD(2) | TZC_REGION_ACCESS_RDWR(3))
