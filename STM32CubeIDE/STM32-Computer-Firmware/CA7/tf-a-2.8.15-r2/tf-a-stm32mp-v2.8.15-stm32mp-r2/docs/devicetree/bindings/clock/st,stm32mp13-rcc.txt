STMicroelectronics STM32 Peripheral Reset Clock Controller
==========================================================

The RCC IP is both a reset and a clock controller.

RCC makes also power management (resume/supend and wakeup interrupt).

Please also refer to reset.txt for common reset controller binding usage.

Please also refer to clock-bindings.txt for common clock controller
binding usage.


Required properties:
- compatible: "st,stm32mp13-rcc", "syscon"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the datasheet
- #clock-cells: 1, device nodes should specify the clock in their
  "clocks" property, containing a phandle to the clock device node,
  an index specifying the clock to use.
- #reset-cells: Shall be 1
- interrupts: Should contain a general interrupt line.
- secure-interrupts: Should contain an interrupt line to the wake-up of
                     processor (CSTOP).

Example:
	rcc: rcc@50000000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32mp13-rcc", "syscon";
		reg = <0x50000000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		secure-interrupts = <GIC_SPI 122 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};

Specifying clocks
=================

All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/stm32mp13-clks.h header and can be used in device
tree sources.

Specifying softreset control of devices
=======================================

Device nodes should specify the reset channel required in their "resets"
property, containing a phandle to the reset device node and an index specifying
which channel to use.
The index is the bit number within the RCC registers bank, starting from RCC
base address.
It is calculated as: index = register_offset / 4 * 32 + bit_offset.
Where bit_offset is the bit offset within the register.

For example on STM32MP13, for I2C2 reset:
 i2c2 = APB1_RSTSETR_offset / 4 * 32 + I2C2_bit_offset
      = 0x6A0 / 4 * 32 + 22 = 13590

The list of valid indices for STM32MP13 is available in:
include/dt-bindings/reset/stm32mp13-resets.h

This file implements defines like:
#define I2C2_R	13590


Defining clock source distribution with property st,clksrc
==========================================================

- st,clksrc : used to configure the peripherals kernel clock selection.

  The property is a list of peripheral kernel clock source identifiers defined
  by macros CLK_<KERNEL-CLOCK>_<PARENT-CLOCK> as defined by header file
  dt-bindings/clock/stm32mp13-clksrc.h.

  st,clksrc may not list all the kernel clocks and has no ordering requirements.

  Property can be used to configure the clock distribution tree.

  Example:
	st,clksrc = <
		CLK_MPU_PLL1P
		CLK_AXI_PLL2P
		CLK_MLAHBS_PLL3
		CLK_RTC_LSE
		CLK_MCO1_DISABLED
		CLK_MCO2_DISABLED
		CLK_ETH1_PLL4P
		CLK_ETH2_PLL4P
		CLK_SDMMC1_PLL4P
		CLK_SDMMC2_PLL4P
		CLK_STGEN_HSE
		CLK_USBPHY_HSE
		CLK_I2C4_HSI
	>;

Defining clock dividers with property st,clkdiv
===============================================

- st,clkdiv : The property is a list of dividers defined
              by macros DIV(DIV_<DIV-CLOCK>, value) as defined by header file
	      dt-bindings/clock/stm32mp13-clksrc.h.

  Property can be used to configure the clock main dividers value.

  For the STM32MP13 family there are 12 dividers values expected.
		MPU AXI MLAHB APB1 APB2 APB3 APB4 APB5 APB6 RTC MCO1 MCO2

  Each divider value uses the DIV coding defined in RCC associated
  register RCC_xxxDIVR. In most cases, it is:
		0x0: not divided
		0x1: division by 2
		0x2: division by 4
		0x3: division by 8
		...

  Note that the coding is different for:

  RTC MCO1 MCO2
		0x0: not divided
		0x1: division by 2
		0x2: division by 3
		0x3: division by 4
		...

  DIV_MPU
		0x0: no clock generated
		0x1: division by 2
		0x2: division by 3
		0x3: division by 4
		...
		0xf: division by 16

  Example:
	st,clkdiv = <
		DIV(DIV_MPU, 1)
		DIV(DIV_AXI, 0)
		DIV(DIV_MLAHB, 0)
		DIV(DIV_APB1, 1)
		DIV(DIV_APB2, 1)
		DIV(DIV_APB3, 1)
		DIV(DIV_APB4, 1)
		DIV(DIV_APB5, 2)
		DIV(DIV_APB6, 1)
		DIV(DIV_RTC, 23)
		DIV(DIV_MCO1, 0)
		DIV(DIV_MCO2, 0)
	>;

Defining peripheral PLL frequencies
========================================================

- children for a PLL static configuration with "st,stm32mp1-pll" compatible

  Each PLL children node for PLL1 to PLL4 (see ref manual for details)
  are listed with associated reg 0 to 3.

  PLL2, PLL3 or PLL4 are off when their associated nodes are absent or
  deactivated.

  The configuration of PLL1, the source clock of Cortex-A7 core, is mandatory
  for TF-A.

      Here are the available properties for each PLL node:
    - compatible: should be "st,stm32mp1-pll"

    - reg: index of the pll instance

    - st,pll: Phandle of the default pll configuration.
              A pll could have several configuration (5 max) and shoud be described in a subnode
              just below.

    - pllx_cfgx node: The PLL configuration node is composed of 2 mandatory parameters:
        - st,pll_vco: Phandle of pll vco configuration.
	              See description of 'st,pll_vco' node.

        - st,pll_div_pqr: The parameters for PLL configuration in the following order:
                          DIVP DIVQ DIVR Output.

			  DIVx values are defined as in RCC spec:
			  0x0: bypass (division by 1)
			  0x1: division by 2
			  0x2: division by 3
			  0x3: division by 4
			  ...
  Note that in the next stage (e.g. OPTEE) the phandle of the default pll configuration
  ('st,pll') could be optional (the configuration of TF-A will be kept).
  The DVFS could apllied configuration at run-time from pllx_cfgx node.

- st,pll_vco node: This node will contain all vco configuration of all PLLs in subnodes.
                   We will found theses parameters in each subnodes.

	   -src: Clock source configuration values are defined by macros CLK_<NAME>_<SOURCE>
                 from dt-bindings/clock/stm32mp13-clksrc.h.

	   -divmn: The parameters for PLL divider (DIVM) and multiplication factor (DIVN)
	           configuration.

	   - frac: Fractional part of the multiplication factor
                   (optional, PLL is in integer mode when absent).

	   - csg: Clock Spreading Generator (optional) with parameters in the
	          following order: MOD_PER INC_STEP SSCG_MODE.

	          MOD_PER: Modulation Period Adjustment
		  INC_STEP: Modulation Depth Adjustment
		  SSCG_MODE: Spread spectrum clock generator mode, with associated
			     defined from stm32mp13-clksrc.h:
		               - SSCG_MODE_CENTER_SPREAD = 0
			       - SSCG_MODE_DOWN_SPREAD = 1

    Example:
	st,pll_vco {
		pll1_vco_1300Mhz: pll1-vco-1300Mhz {
			src = <CLK_PLL12_HSE>;
			divmn = <2 80>;
			frac = <0x800>;
		};
		...
		pll2_vco_1066Mhz: pll2-vco-1066Mhz {
			src = <CLK_PLL12_HSE>;
			divmn = <2 65>;
			frac = <0x1400>;
			csg = <10 20 1>;
		};
		...
	};

	pll1:st,pll@0 {
		compatible = "st,stm32mp1-pll";
		reg = <0>;

		st,pll = <&pll1_cfg1>;

		pll1_cfg1: pll1_cfg1 {
			st,pll_vco = <&pll1_vco_1300Mhz>;
			st,pll_div_pqr = <0 1 1>;
		};
	};

	st,pll@1 {
		compatible = "st,stm32mp1-pll";
		reg = <1>;

		st,pll = <&pll2_cfg1>;

		pll2_cfg1: pll2_cfg1 {
			st,pll_vco = <&pll2_vco_1066Mhz>;
			st,pll_div_pqr = <1 0 1>;
		};
	};

  Note: pll1 and pll2 have same source clock, if source clock is different
  between pll1 and pll2 a panic will be generated.

Fixed clocks description
========================

The clock tree is also based on 5 fixed-clock in clocks node
used to define the state of associated ST32MP1 oscillators:
  - clk-lsi
  - clk-lse
  - clk-hsi
  - clk-hse
  - clk-csi

At boot the clock tree initialization will
  - enable oscillators present in device tree and not disabled
    (node with status="disabled"),
  - disable HSI oscillator if the node is absent (always activated by bootrom)
    or disabled (node with status="disabled").

Optional properties :

a) for external oscillator: "clk-lse", "clk-hse"

  4 optional fields are managed
  - "st,bypass" configures the oscillator bypass mode (HSEBYP, LSEBYP)
  - "st,digbypass" configures the bypass mode as full-swing digital
    signal (DIGBYP)
  - "st,css" activates the clock security system (HSECSSON, LSECSSON)
  - "st,drive" (only for LSE) contains the value of the drive for the
     oscillator (see LSEDRV_ defined in the file
     dt-bindings/clock/stm32mp13-clksrc.h)

  Example board file:
	/ {
		clocks {
			clk_hse: clk-hse {
				#clock-cells = <0>;
				compatible = "fixed-clock";
				clock-frequency = <24000000>;
				st,bypass;
			};

			clk_lse: clk-lse {
				#clock-cells = <0>;
				compatible = "fixed-clock";
				clock-frequency = <32768>;
				st,css;
				st,drive = <LSEDRV_LOWEST>;
			};
	};

b) for internal oscillator: "clk-hsi"

  Internally HSI clock is fixed to 64MHz for STM32MP13 SoC.
  In device tree, clk-hsi is the clock after HSIDIV (clk_hsi in RCC
  doc). So this clock frequency is used to compute the expected HSI_DIV
  for the clock tree initialization.

  Example with HSIDIV = /1:
	/ {
		clocks {
			clk_hsi: clk-hsi {
				#clock-cells = <0>;
				compatible = "fixed-clock";
				clock-frequency = <64000000>;
			};
	};

  Example with HSIDIV = /2
	/ {
		clocks {
			clk_hsi: clk-hsi {
				#clock-cells = <0>;
				compatible = "fixed-clock";
				clock-frequency = <32000000>;
			};
	};

HSI & CSI calibration
========================

Calibration is an optional feature that may be enabled from device tree. It
allows to request calibration of the HSI or the CSI clocks from several means:
	- SiP SMC service
	- Periodic calibration every X seconds

This feature requires that a HW timer is assigned to the calibration sequence.

- st,hsi-cal: used to enable HSI clock calibration feature.

- st,csi-cal: used to enable CSI clock calibration feature.

- st,cal-sec: used to enable periodic calibration every specified seconds from
  secure monitor. Time must be given in seconds. If not specified, calibration
  is processed for each incoming request.

Example:
	&rcc {
		st,hsi-cal;
		st,csi-cal;
		st,cal-sec = <15>;
		secure-interrupts = <GIC_SPI 122 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		secure-interrupt-names = "wakeup";
	};


Clocks and Operating Performance Points
=======================================

- st,clk_opp node: This node will contain all operating point configurations.
		   We can have 3 operating points:
		     - st,ck_mpu
		     - st,ck_axi
		     - ck_mlahbs
		   These nodes are not mandatory, but we have to respect the naming.

                   Each node will contain a list of operating point configurations (cfg_1, cfg_2...)

                   These configuration subnodes contain these properties:

		   mandatory parameters:
		     -hz: Operating point frequency in hertz

		     -st,clksrc: The clock source (same syntax of 'st,clksrc' property below)

		   optional parameters:
		     -st,clkdiv: The clock divider value (same syntax of 'st,clkdiv' property below)

                     -st,pll: Phandle of the pll configuration (See description of 'pllx_cfgx' node)

  Note that this OPP configuration will be apllied at the run-time and will override the clock tree
  configuration.

  Example:
			st,clk_opp {
				st,ck_mpu {
					cfg_1 {
						hz = <900000000>;
						st,clksrc = <CLK_MPU_PLL1P>;
						st,pll = <&pll1_cfg1>;
					};

					cfg_2 {
						hz = <650000000>;
						st,clksrc = <CLK_MPU_PLL1P>;
						st,pll = <&pll1_cfg2>;
					}
