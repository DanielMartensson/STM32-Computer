STMicroelectronics STM32MP1 Power Management Controller
=======================================================

The PWR IP is responsible for handling the power related resources such as
clocks, power supplies and resets. It provides 6 wake-up pins that are handled
by an interrupt-controller. Wake-up pin can be used to wake-up from STANDBY SoC
state.

Required properties:
- compatible should be: "st,stm32mp1-pwr", "st,stm32-pwr"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet

Optional Properties:
- Nodes corresponding to PSCI commands issued by kernel:
  - system_suspend_supported_soc_modes: list of supported SoC modes in suspend
  - system_off_soc_mode: SoC mode for shutdown
  - st,retram-enabled-in-standby-ddr-sr: enable retram during standby-ddr-sr

The list of SoC modes is in include/dt-bindings/power/stm32mp1-power.h:
  - modes for system_suspend
	1 -> STM32_PM_CSTOP_ALLOW_STOP
	2 -> STM32_PM_CSTOP_ALLOW_LP_STOP
	3 -> STM32_PM_CSTOP_ALLOW_LPLV_STOP
	4 -> STM32_PM_CSTOP_ALLOW_STANDBY_DDR_SR
  - modes for system_off
	6 -> STM32_PM_CSTOP_ALLOW_STANDBY_DDR_OFF
	7 -> STM32_PM_SHUTDOWN

Example:

pwr: pwr@50001000 {
	compatible = "st,stm32mp1-pwr", "st,stm32-pwr", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	reg = <0x50001000 0x400>;

	system_suspend_supported_soc_modes = <
		STM32_PM_CSLEEP_RUN
		STM32_PM_CSTOP_ALLOW_LP_STOP
		STM32_PM_CSTOP_ALLOW_STANDBY_DDR_SR
	>;

	system_off_soc_mode = <STM32_PM_CSTOP_ALLOW_STANDBY_DDR_OFF>;
};
